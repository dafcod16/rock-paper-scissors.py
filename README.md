# Rock Paper Scissors Game
For this project, I wanted to create another interactive game that allowed me to understand the logic of if-elif-else statements better.
This also allowed me to use a list for the first time. Doing this really helped simplify a lot of my code and keep it very condensed. 
In my final loop I learned a lot about the logistical coding. Instead of creating 3 seperate cases for computerPick, I just used an else statement knowing that if I did not win, I had to have lost. It was nice to have cleaned up a lot of common poor coding practices.
